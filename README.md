# Earthquake Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard for analyzing earthquake data. The dashboard provides insights into earthquake patterns over time, by location, and by depth, and includes visualizations for various aspects such as magnitude distribution, monthly and yearly trends, depth distribution, and location-based mapping.

## Features
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
- **Total Earthquakes by Magnitude**: A bar chart showing the distribution of earthquakes by magnitude.
- **Total Earthquakes by Month**: Displays the frequency of earthquakes across each month.
- **Total Earthquakes by Place**: A map visualization that plots earthquake occurrences by geographic location.
- **Depth and Magnitude Relationship**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude.
- **Depth Histogram**: A histogram visualizing the distribution of earthquake depths.
- **Total Earthquakes by Year**: Line chart showing the yearly trend of earthquakes.
